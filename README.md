Placeholder name: Project Hedgehog
Version: 1.0.0-dev.1

**App Purpose:** 
I noticed two main types of food tracking apps: 
  1. Text-based, weight-loss-focused apps – These require users to input weight, weight-based goals, and daily caloric limits. If users exceed their set calorie intake, they are often met with punitive design     
     elements (bars changing to red, text about exceeding limits). Conversely, when under budget, a remaining "calories left" count can unintentionally encourage unnecessary eating just to meet the goal.

  2. Image-based food journals – These focus on logging meals visually without a weight-loss or calorie-goal component. While useful for some, I found these inconvenient because it was not always situationally 
     ideal to take a photo of my food, sometimes I would forget to do so and could not after the fact, and other times I did not have my phone on me. Additionally, these apps tend to take up more storage than 
     text-based alternatives.

Furthermore, while I have seen many food apps encourage adherence to calorie-based diets, I have not seen an app allow users to set their own ethical, religious, or preference based diets and filter the food database according to these preferences. 
     
Because humans are inconstant beings and no day is the same, it's not realistic to always eat the same amount of calories everyday. Different activitiy levels on different days may influence eating, and punitive designs can be discouraging to users and lead them to abandon the app and their tracking all together. 

Project Hedgehog aims to address these issues by providing a streamlined, simple, and highly-customizable app which allows individuals to track their food intake without unnecessary constraints or judgment. Additionally, there are default presets which make it easy to use without customizing. Project Hedgehog is great for people who want a simple and customizable food journal to give them insight into what they eat on the day-to-day. Individuals with, or recovering from, eating disorders might also find this app useful because it does not "punish" for going over calories, nor require you to make weight or calorie goals at all.

**Who Might Like This App**
  • People who want to a textual journal of what they eat, perhaps without a daily caloric goal. 
  • People with specific diets who do not want to see food not pertinent to their diet (vegans, vegetarians, people with religious dietary concerns (Halal, Kosher, Sattvic, etc.))
  • People recovering from eating disorders who do not want to include or see calories, macronutrients, or weights. 
  • People who value user customizability and control of themes, UI, diet-types, and data. 
  • People who like graphs.
  • ... and more!

**App Features**
My app will achieve the following: 
  • Be free and open-source.
  • Value privacy: this is a pledge that your information will never be collected, viewed, or kept by any party, including the developer, besides yourself.
  • Focus on mindfulness of diet rather than weight loss or calories, but provide these options if the user wishes to use them. 
  • Be highly customizable by the user. 
  • Function offline.
  • Be space efficient.   

Users can: 
  • Set and create diet types, which then excludes the appropriate foods from the database.
  • Customize the amount of detail for foods (minimum: name, appendable: calories, macros, additional nutrients, personal notes, and whatever else they like).
  • Add their own foods.
  • Remove features, customize the UI and available pages.
  • Keep a journal if they wish.
  • See weekly, monthly, and annual information about their food consumption.
